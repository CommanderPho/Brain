**A separate software serial branch of this the Arduino Brain Library project is no longer required (or maintained) thanks to improvements in Arduino 1.0!**

Please don't build anything new with this branch.

Please see the [master branch](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Arduino-Brain-Library/tree/master) and specifically the [software serial example sketch](https://github.com/kitschpatrol/Arduino-Brain-Library/blob/master/Brain/examples/BrainSoftSerialTest/BrainSoftSerialTest.ino) for more info.
